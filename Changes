Revision history for Test-JSON

        Upgrade Test::Tester dependency to 0.107.  This fixes an intermittant

        http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=48509

        Need dependency on JSON::Any 1.20 or greater.  This resolves rt #32957
        Inherit from Test::Builder::Module instead of rolling my own exporter.

        Ensure that we can run with subtests by not having Test::Builder->new
